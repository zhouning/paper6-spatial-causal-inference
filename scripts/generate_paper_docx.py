    add_para(doc, "Predicting land-use and land-cover (LULC) change is fundamental to geographic information science, yet existing methods either operate on discrete categorical maps (CA-Markov, ConvLSTM) or require prohibitively large pixel-level generative models (EarthPT, DiffusionSat). We propose a geospatial world model that predicts LULC change entirely within a learned embedding space, following the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm. Our approach combines a frozen geospatial foundation model---Google AlphaEarth Foundations (480M+ parameters)---as a fixed encoder producing 64-dimensional per-pixel embeddings, with a lightweight LatentDynamicsNet (459K parameters) that learns residual state transitions in this embedding space via autoregressive rollout. We introduce three key technical contributions: (1) explicit L2 re-normalization after each autoregressive step to prevent manifold drift on the unit hypersphere; (2) dilated convolutions (dilation rates 1, 2, 4) to expand the receptive field from 50 m to 170 m for capturing macro-scale land-use drivers; and (3) multi-step unrolled training loss with decaying weights to mitigate exposure bias in long-horizon prediction. A formal ablation study confirms that all three components are critical: removing L2 normalization degrades training advantage by 62%, removing dilated convolutions reduces change-pixel advantage by 32%, and removing unrolled loss causes the validation set to turn negative. Experiments span 17 study areas across China (12 training, 2 validation, 1 test, 2 out-of-distribution), with 500 sample points per area per year over 2017-2024, evaluated against two baselines (persistence and linear extrapolation). On the 12 training areas, the model achieves a mean cosine similarity of 0.9575 with ground truth, surpassing the persistence baseline (0.9460) on all 12 areas (+0.014 average). Critically, on pixels that underwent actual land-use change (top 20% by embedding displacement), the model advantage amplifies to +0.030 to +0.108 over persistence. The validation set shows positive advantage (+0.002), and OOD degradation is limited to -0.012. Multi-step rollout sustains above-baseline quality for up to 6 autoregressive steps on training areas. These results demonstrate that frozen foundation model embeddings provide a viable state space for geospatial world modeling, achieving meaningful dynamics learning with three orders of magnitude fewer parameters than comparable autoregressive earth observation models.")

    # 1. Introduction
    add_heading(doc, "1. Introduction")
    add_para(doc, "Predicting how land surfaces will change over time is a central problem in geographical information science, with direct applications in urban planning, agricultural policy, ecological conservation, and climate adaptation. Traditional approaches---cellular automata-Markov chains (CA-Markov), CLUE-S, and logistic regression---operate on categorical land-use maps, relying on hand-calibrated transition probabilities and socioeconomic driving factors. While effective in constrained scenarios, these methods cannot capture the rich, continuous spectral-spatial-temporal information present in modern satellite observations.")
    add_para(doc, "Recent advances in deep learning have introduced more powerful alternatives. Convolutional-recurrent architectures (ConvLSTM) can learn spatiotemporal patterns from classified imagery sequences. EarthPT, a 700M-parameter autoregressive transformer, predicts pixel-level spectral reflectance forward in time. DiffusionSat uses conditional diffusion models to generate future satellite images. However, all of these operate in raw observation space (spectral bands or classified pixels), inheriting two fundamental limitations: (1) prediction in high-dimensional pixel space is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination artifacts; and (2) pixel-level prediction conflates semantically meaningful change with irrelevant noise.")
    add_para(doc, "In the broader AI community, the concept of a world model---a learned internal simulator that predicts environment state transitions in a compressed latent space---has emerged as a powerful paradigm. Pioneered by Ha & Schmidhuber (2018) and advanced through Dreamer V3 (Hafner et al., 2023) and MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), world models separate perception from dynamics. LeCun's JEPA framework (2022) formalizes this principle: predict in representation space, not pixel space.")
    add_para(doc, "Simultaneously, geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs) have made pre-trained representations freely available. AlphaEarth Foundations (Brown et al., 2025) produces 64-dimensional L2-normalized embedding vectors at 10 m resolution for every land pixel on Earth, annually from 2017 to 2024. These embeddings have been shown to be physically interpretable (Rahman, 2026) and linearly decodable to land-cover classes with >83% accuracy.")
    add_para(doc, "This paper bridges these two developments: we treat GeoFM embeddings as the state space of a geospatial world model. Our key insight is that if a foundation model has already learned to compress satellite observations into semantically meaningful, temporally varying embeddings, then the dynamics of land-use change can be learned on top of these frozen embeddings using a lightweight neural network. This corresponds precisely to JEPA: the foundation model serves as the encoder; a small LatentDynamicsNet serves as the predictor.")

The frozen-encoder approach decouples representation quality from dynamics learning, enabling 459K-parameter dynamics training in <2 minutes on CPU.")
    add_para(doc, "Why the model works on changing pixels. The change-pixel analysis reveals that the model's advantage concentrates on pixels undergoing genuine transitions (+0.030 to +0.108), while stable pixels are near-identical to persistence. The model has learned to identify which embeddings are in unstable pre-transition states.")
    add_heading(doc, "6.3 Interpretability and geographic theory alignment", level=2)
    add_para(doc, "Spatial autocorrelation and Tobler's First Law. Tobler's First Law of Geography states that 'near things are more related than distant things' (Tobler, 1970). Our dilated convolutional architecture (receptive field 170 m) is a direct computational implementation of this principle: each pixel's predicted future state is determined by its spatial neighborhood. The ablation study confirms this --- removing dilated convolutions reduces change-pixel advantage by 32%, demonstrating that macro-scale spatial context is essential for land-use transitions at the urban-rural interface.")
    add_para(doc, "Spatial diffusion theory. Hagerstrand's spatial diffusion theory posits that land-use changes propagate outward from centers of origin. The convolutional dynamics naturally encode this pattern: urbanized pixels at the city edge 'influence' adjacent agricultural pixels, producing gradual outward expansion. The transition matrices confirm this --- dominant transitions (cropland to shrubland, cropland to water) concentrate at boundary zones rather than occurring uniformly.")
    add_para(doc, "Linear decodability as semantic interpretability. The 83.5% accuracy of a linear probe (logistic regression) in decoding LULC classes demonstrates that the 64-dimensional embedding space is linearly separable with respect to land-cover semantics. The residual delta_z predicted by the dynamics model can be decomposed along the linear classifier's decision boundaries: its magnitude indicates change intensity, and its direction reveals which land-cover transition is predicted. Unlike pixel-level generative models where intermediate representations are opaque, our predictions remain in a semantically structured space throughout the autoregressive rollout.")
    add_para(doc, "Relationship to classical LULC models. The autoregressive formulation z_{t+1} = f(z_t, sigma) is mathematically a continuous-state Markov process, generalizing discrete CA-Markov transition matrices to a 64-dimensional continuous manifold. The transition matrix output provides a direct bridge to practitioners familiar with Markov-based modeling, while the underlying continuous dynamics retain richer information than categorical transitions.")
    add_para(doc, "Scenario conditioning caveat. All training data uses the baseline scenario (historical observations). The scenario-conditioning architecture is in place but untrained for counterfactual scenarios. Activating it requires scenario-labeled training data (e.g., regions with known policy interventions) — this is identified as the primary direction for future work.")
    add_para(doc, "Limitations. (1) Annual temporal resolution limits sub-year dynamics. (2) Scenario conditioning currently operates only on baseline (see above). (3) 170 m receptive field may miss city-scale drivers. (4) Extreme biomes absent from training would show degradation.")

    # 7. Conclusions
    add_heading(doc, "7. Conclusions")
    add_para(doc, "We have presented a geospatial world model that predicts land-use change entirely within the embedding space of a frozen geospatial foundation model. By combining AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings (480M+ parameter encoder) with a lightweight LatentDynamicsNet (459K parameters), we demonstrate that meaningful temporal dynamics can be learned with three orders of magnitude fewer parameters than comparable models. Key findings: (1) model surpasses persistence on 12/12 training areas and on the validation set; (2) on genuinely changing pixels, advantage is 2-10x larger than global metrics; (3) multi-step unrolled training extends prediction horizon from 3 to 6 years; (4) scaling training diversity from 2 to 12 areas reduces OOD degradation by 94%; (5) ablation study confirms all three innovations are critical, with L2 normalization being the most impactful (-62% when removed). We note that scenario conditioning is architecturally in place but currently trained only on baseline; activating counterfactual simulation is a primary future direction.")

    add_para(doc, "预测土地利用/覆盖（LULC）变化是地理信息科学的核心问题，然而现有方法要么在离散类别地图上操作（CA-Markov、ConvLSTM），要么需要计算代价极高的像素级生成模型（EarthPT、DiffusionSat）。本文提出了一种地理空间世界模型，遵循联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA）范式，完全在学习到的嵌入空间中预测LULC变化。我们的方法将冻结的地理空间基础模型——Google AlphaEarth Foundations（480M+参数）——作为固定编码器产生64维逐像素嵌入向量，与轻量级LatentDynamicsNet（459K参数）相结合，后者通过自回归展开学习该嵌入空间中的残差状态转移。我们引入三个关键技术贡献：（1）每步自回归后显式L2重归一化以防止单位超球面上的流形漂移；（2）空洞卷积（膨胀率1、2、4）将感受野从50 m扩展到170 m以捕捉宏观尺度的土地利用驱动因素；（3）带衰减权重的多步展开训练损失以缓解长时域预测中的暴露偏差。正式的消融实验证实三个组件均不可或缺：移除L2归一化使训练集优势下降62%，移除空洞卷积使变化像素优势下降32%，移除展开损失导致验证集转负。实验涵盖中国17个研究区域（12个训练、2个验证、1个测试、2个域外），每个区域每年500个采样点，覆盖2017-2024年，与两个基线（持续性和线性外推）对比评估。在12个训练区域上，模型与真实值的平均余弦相似度达到0.9575，超越持续性基线（0.9460），全部12个区域均优于基线（平均+0.014）。关键发现：在实际发生土地利用变化的像素（嵌入位移前20%）上，模型优势放大至+0.030至+0.108。验证集显示正向优势（+0.002），域外退化仅为-0.012。多步展开在训练区域可维持6步自回归高于基线的预测质量。这些结果表明，冻结的基础模型嵌入为地理空间世界建模提供了可行的状态空间，以少于可比模型三个数量级的参数量实现了有意义的动力学学习。")

    add_para(doc, "预测地表随时间的变化是地理信息科学的核心问题，在城市规划、农业政策、生态保护和气候适应方面有直接应用。传统方法——元胞自动机-马尔可夫链（CA-Markov）、CLUE-S和逻辑回归——在分类土地利用地图上操作，依赖于手工标定的转移概率和社会经济驱动因子。虽然在受限场景中有效，但这些方法无法捕捉现代卫星观测中丰富的、连续的光谱-空间-时间信息。")
    add_para(doc, "深度学习的最新进展引入了更强大的替代方案。卷积递归架构（ConvLSTM）可以从分类影像序列中学习时空模式。EarthPT是一个7亿参数的自回归Transformer，在像素级预测光谱反射率。DiffusionSat使用条件扩散模型生成未来卫星影像。然而，所有这些方法都在原始观测空间（光谱波段或分类像素）中操作，存在两个根本局限：（1）高维像素空间中的预测计算代价高且易产生幻觉伪影；（2）像素级预测将语义有意义的变化与无关噪声混为一谈。")
    add_para(doc, "在更广泛的AI领域，世界模型概念——一个在压缩潜空间中预测环境状态转移的学习系统——已成为规划和推理的强大范式。由Ha和Schmidhuber（2018）开创，经Dreamer V3（Hafner等，2023）和MuZero（Schrittwieser等，2020）推进，世界模型将感知（将观测编码为潜状态）与动力学（预测潜状态转移）分离。LeCun的JEPA框架（2022）将这一原则形式化：在表征空间中预测，而非像素空间。")
    add_para(doc, "与此同时，地理空间基础模型（GeoFM）使地球表面的预训练高质量表征变得免费可用。AlphaEarth Foundations（Brown等，2025）在Google Earth Engine上为地球每个陆地像素提供10 m分辨率、64维、L2归一化的嵌入向量，年度覆盖2017-2024年。这些嵌入已被证明具有物理可解释性（Rahman，2026），并可通过线性分类器以>83%精度解码为土地覆盖类别。")
    add_para(doc, "本文桥接了这两个发展方向：我们将GeoFM嵌入作为地理空间世界模型的状态空间。核心洞察是：如果基础模型已经学会将卫星观测压缩为语义有意义的、随时间变化的嵌入，那么土地利用变化的动力学可以在这些冻结嵌入之上用轻量级神经网络学习——无需重新训练基础模型，也无需生成像素级预测。这精确对应于JEPA架构：基础模型是编码器；小型LatentDynamicsNet是预测器。")
